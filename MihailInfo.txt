Hello Everyone! 
My name is Mihail Mihaylov and I am from Varna.
My hobbies are sports and cars.
I decided it is time for a career change in order to spend more time with my family (my current job requires A LOT of travel).
Software engineering provides a great chance to do that, while enjoying your work, and SoftUni is definately the best place to get those skills.
