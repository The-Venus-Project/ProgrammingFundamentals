My name is Velizar Velikov.
I was born in Rousse, living in Sofia for the last 10 years.
I like to spend my free time modelling different subjects in 72 scale. I also like to dance salsa and bachata.
I chose SoftUni, because I think that programming will be one of the professions wich will not become obsolete in the next 30 years because of 
more and more automation, computerization and cybernation in economics.
