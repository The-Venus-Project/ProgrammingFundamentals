Hello all,
My name is Svilen Velikov.
I live at the moment in Ruse. My hobbies are dancing (Bulgarian folkore dances, semba, kizomba, salsa, bachata), swimming, etc.
I wanted to change something in my life. So I decided to study in SoftUni. As a kid my dream was to become a programmer and to work with numbers. So, maybe I will accomplish my dream.
