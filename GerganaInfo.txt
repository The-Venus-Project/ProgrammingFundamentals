Hi Everyone! 
My name is Gergana.
I was born in Shumen.
I like to spend my free time with friends. Also I like to practice different kinds of sport like volleyball, running, swimming, but
also dancing and hiking.
I chose SoftUni, because I think it will bring me one step closer to becoming a software engineer. Also SoftUni distinguishes from the other universities 
by providing more practical experience and quality education.
